I have been playing accordion solitaire of and on for around 60 years, and I have
never made it come out.  The rules require that you turn up the cards one at a
time, and if the card can be played on top of a pile, you must play it.  I have 
always wondered how hard the game would be if you could lay out all the cards to 
begin with, and then make any legal move you chose.  This is quite awkward with 
52 physical cards, but easy with a computer.  Hence this program.
